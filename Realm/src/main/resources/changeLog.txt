Version								Date			Changes
Realm-04-20-2008.zip			04/20/2008			Fixed the die roller issues after talking with Mark.  Added the menu on the main app with a 'help' menu with a 'version' menu item.
Realm-04-16-2008.zip			04/16/2008			Added the die roller application.  Added the 'recent criticals' list panel to the critical hits app.  The die roller still needs requirements
																		for the gm configured die and for the differences between the open ended and open ended up die. Also the roll total text box needs
																		to be changed to a spinner so Mark can modify it.  Need definition on how to save rolls when he clicks on the spinner though - do you save
																		every change or only the last one?  How do you know it's the last one?
Realm-07-17-2008.zip			5/26/2008			Changed data in the Cold Critical Hits.xml to change entries with a severity of B# to B.  Changed Melee to MELEE in the Crust Critical Hits.xml
																		Added Plasma, Acid, Disintegrations, Large Creature, Spell Failure,  Super Large Creatures, Vibrations critical hits to the critical hits application. 
																		 Have Bill check these - there are some missing entries.  There was no new code in here, just these new critical hit data files.
Realm-07-24-2008.zip			7/24/2008			Added Herb Lore.  UPdated critical hits files for Vibrations, Super Large Creature Spell, Super Large Creature, Spell Failure, Shock,  Plasma, Large Creature, Large Creature Spell, Disintigration,
																		did not do the acid.csv.txt - it was screwed up.
Realm-07-25-2008.zip			7/25/2008			Updated the acid critical hits with a new file from Bill.  Changed the severities on some of the critical hits thusly.  For Large Creature Spell an Super Large Creature Spell, changed 
																		severity 'A' to 'Normal' and 'E' to 'Magic'.  For Large Creature and Super Large Creature changed severity 'A' to 'Normal, 'B' to 'Magic', 'C' to 'Mithril', 'D' to 'Holy Arms', and 'E' to 'Slaying'.
																		Also changed the severity names in super large critical hits so that they are camel case and not all upper case.
Realm-10-23-2008.zip			10/23/2008			Updated the HerbLoreFrameController so it would display the cost/rarity - it was mistakenly putting the classification there.  Added two critical hit files that Mark made.  These are the
																		Spell_Failure_Elem_Attk Critical Hits.xml and the Spell_Failure_Force_Attk Critical Hits.xml file.  These might replace the existing Spell Failure Critical Hits.xml file, but Mark hasn't confirmed
																		that yet.  Added the Character and Combat applications.  So far, Combat only creates new rounds which have an entry for every character with an initiative calculated.  The initiative is
																		the characters base initiative plus an 100 die open ended roll.
Realm-10-30-2008.zip			10/30/2008			Removed the original spell failure critical hits file.  Mark's new ones replace that one.  Changed the name of all the windows to Stevie-ware.  Changed the character and player table list so that the number of rows will expand
																		to 1 more than the number of characters or players - this is so you can always add another player, even when you've filled up the existing space on the table. Added some more critical hits files from Mark - Spell Failure Non Attack
																		Informational Spells Critical Hits, Spell Failure Non Attk Other Spells Critical Hits, Spell_Failure_Elem_Attack Critical Hits, Spell_Failure_Elem_attack Critical Hits, and Impact Critical Hits.
Stevieware0.0.3.zip				11/11/2008			1)  Removed the id field from the player screen.  2)  Added the 'delete' button to the player screen.  3) changed the character frame controller so that when the save button is clicked, 
																		the frame is then hidden - so that Mark isn't confused about which character he's working on, 4) changed the character list so it would show more than just 10 characters, 5) added the
																		delete and delete all buttons to the player screen, 6) added the delete all button to the character screen, 7) added a row number column to the character list and combat table so Mark
																		can easily see how many of each he has, 8) changed the location that the screens open so they're not on top of each other any more, 9) changed the critical hit screen so only the severities
																		that are valid for a chosen type are displayed in the severity combo box, 10) changed the numeric values on the character screen so they don't format with commas - hopefully this will
																		fix the problem Mark saw when he had a value that had 4 or more digits, 11) lastly, added the rounds still stunned, bleeding, and negative modifier columns to the combat table.  That does it.
Stevieware0.0.4.zip				01/07/2009			1) Changed the ids of the characters and players to just use a integer instead of a UUID.  This is so Mark can have an easily readable id for them.  Also changed the character and player screens to display this id.	
													Mark will have to either delete all his players and characters or send them to me so I can fix the IDs in the XML.  2) changed the negative modifier on the combat screen so it's always a negative value - regardless of
													what is entered.  3) Added the 'regeneration' to the combat statistics and view.	4) added the 'holy weapon' critical hit file that Mark made.  5) Added the 'initiative modifier' to Character and included it in all
													initiative calculations for rounds.  This is a constant that works essentially just like the regular initiative except it's something that Mark controls.  Added the character defensive attributes fields and screen.
													6) Fixed a bug where Observation wasn't persisting.  	7)  Changed the label of the characters 'perception' field to Misc in the character list and character attributes screens.  8) Added the characters defensive
													attributes.		
Steveieware0.4.1				01/11/2008			1) Fixed a bug in the combat screen where it wouldn't display > 15 characters. 2) Added the Heat Critical Hits.xml  and Time Critical Hits.xml files from Mark.
Stevieware 0.5.0				02/03/2009			1) Changed the 'Def Bonus' label in the character list to 'total defense'. 2) Changed the 'has shield' and 'has adrenal defense' values in the character list to display yes/no instead of true/false. 3) added the
													'hit points' attribute to character and displayed in on the character list.  3) Modified combat so that the number of hits a character starts the round with is displayed as well as the number of hits a character ends
													the round with is displayed.  The math is starting hits - hits taken this round - bleeding + regeneration = ending hits.  Added tool tips to help describe this.  Modified combat so new rounds start with the number of
													hits the last round ended with.
Stevieware 0.6.0				03/xx/2009			1) Added persistence to the combat stuff.  2) added a subtotal defense calculation that includes all defense except adrenal defense.  Added this new number to the character list and defensive attributes
													list screens.  3) Added Items.
Stevieware 0.7.0				08/09/2010			1) Changed the combat encounter list to make it easier to add a combat.  Added an 'add' button.  To create a combat encounter, click the 'add' button, then optionally enter a description - right in the table.
													2) Created a new column on the 'character list' and the 'defensive attributes' screens called 'defense minus adrenal' column that contains everything the current total has except the 'adrenal defense' number.  Rearranged the columns in the table to make them more logical.
													3) Added persistence to combat.
													4) Added will contests. Add items using the 'item list' button from the main menu.  Add will contests by clicking on the 'will contest list' button on the main menu. Then create a contest.  Contests will be saved from game to game.
													5) Added alertness and observation rolls to the combat table.  It takes the base alertness and observation for each character and adds an open ended 100 sided die roll.
													6) Added hit point modifiers.  The modifier is specified on the character screen.  The modifier is used with a combat is started and can not be changed throughout that combat.  If the modifier is changed and a second combat is started, that second combat will use the changed value.
Stevieware0.8.0										1) Added movement-maneuver.   
													2) Add versioning to the critical hits and movement maneuver.  Allow mark to pick which version he wants to use on the UI. Allow him to vary for each critical lookup.  Restructure the folders to make it easier for them to keep different versions of the files separate.
